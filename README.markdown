## Getting started

### Quick Use

It is recommend to simply copy `JSONitor.exe` to where you would like to store the executable and generated info file.  From there, you may double click to run the exe.

### Python Install

If preferred or if they above method does not work, you may install
module requirements (PyQt5, Qscintilla, QtAwesome, and Pyperclip) by changing to the source folder and running:

    pip3 install -r requirements.txt

Once the requirements are installed, you can run JSONitor using Python 3 in the source folder.

    python3 JSONitor.py

The application window should appear.

## Basic Usage

Has many functions of a regular text editor, but also features a tree view which can be edited and transferred back to JSON in the text view.

Additional documentation to come.

## Debugging

The log file, created in whichever folder JSONitor is run from, provides information about JSONitor processes, but if you encounter any errors in the code, please file an issue on github: [https://github.com/AaronAikman/JSONitor/issues](https://github.com/AaronAikman/JSONitor/issues).
